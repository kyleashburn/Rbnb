# Rbnb
In this project I made in a class, I worked to try to figure out a common set of predictors for success on AirBnb. I based my work on the assumption that what would be a useful attribute for a listing in one financial hub (Hong Kong) would be a useful attribute for a listing in another financial hub (London). I found my data on [inside Airbnbn](http://insideairbnb.com/). 
One of the issues I ran into early on was that Hong Kong's dataset was substantially smaller than London's. Thus, I pivoted to try to train my models on the London dataset while testing on the Hong Kong dataset. My approach for data cleaning (I did my work in R) was to try to reduce the attributes to ones a listing owner could control while just dropping when there wasn't data (I didn't want to risk imputation here). 
My actual modeling was done in Orange Rapid Miner (because that was one of the class requirements, using multiple platforms for your work). My models ended up achieving between 67 and 70% accuracy which is pretty good for a Decision Tree, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, & Logistic Regression model. 

One of the biggest challenges I had to deal with in this project is that my data format changed in the middle of my work. Having to pivot in the middle of a project because the data pipiline changed on you was an informative experience to say the least.
While the models were reasonably accurate, I'm not sure they were terribly helpful. I _could_ tease out some trends in between cities, but overall it just wasn't really helpful enough. I would probably recommend just trying to go for looking at the data without modeling because you can find some useful hints that way. One area I messed up was underestimating the amount of data cleaning would prove to be. Overall, I learned that it's important to plan ahead and have clear objectives. I think my lack of a clearer plan at times hindered my progress. I also learned that it's unwise to trust the data design will stay stable over the course of a project.
