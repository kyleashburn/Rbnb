I'm a very artistically inclined person, interested in photography, documentaries,  and writing, that includes articles, short stories and poems. I've worked in the Hospitality industry my whole life with brief stints in other fields. Currently I work on a freelance basis for various orgs and non profits.

Due to the reason that Sep-Apr is peak season, you are advised to make your reservation earlier.   I can only do first book first serve basis, where I won't cancel current booking just because other guests have a longer / bigger booking.  Due to strict cancellation policy, I haven't cancel guest booking so far, except from time to time having guest need to cancel or amend their booking due to different reason and we will considerate case by case (so far only full refund to 1 group of guest as they are able to provide document to proof that their immediate family member need emergency operation). 

Max Capacity is cater to big group consists of family n kids with standard asian size.  If group with members with huge body size or some members prefer to have a bed by their own, not sharing with other, then please split your group into two apartments for more comfortable stay.  I have tried my best to write the apartment description as detail as I could. Please spend time to read through before you book.  I am definitely happy to answer any question that is not in the apartment description.

1. Positive Girl, always think optimistic. 
2. On schedule, always follow what I have planned and acheived 
3. Helpful, Always help others and be volunteer 
4. Considerate, always think of other people's feeling 
5. Passionate, once I devote to join and do a task, I will enjoy and actively participate
6. Keep on learning, I am studying property management and Korean 

My Philosophy:
Enjoy life, enjoy helping others. I study Economics and learn oppotunity cost. But to me, money ( enjoy working by my hands rather money fall into my pocket) and leisure must get a balance.

Due to the reason that Sep-Apr is peak season, you are advised to make your reservation earlier.   I can only do first book first serve basis, where I won't cancel current booking just because other guests have a longer / bigger booking.  Due to strict cancellation policy, I haven't cancel guest booking so far, except from time to time having guest need to cancel or amend their booking due to different reason and we will considerate case by case (so far only full refund to 1 group of guest as they are able to provide document to proof that their immediate family member need emergency operation). 

Max Capacity is cater to big group consists of family n kids with standard asian size.  If group with members with huge body size or some members prefer to have a bed by their own, not sharing with other, then please split your group into two apartments for more comfortable stay.  I have tried my best to write the apartment description as detail as I could. Please spend time to read through before you book.  I am definitely happy to answer any question that is not in the apartment description.

Ryan is from London and Krystal is originally from Hong Kong.

We both run our own businesses and travel regularly for our jobs and for leisure of course! Blessed with the proximity to other fantastic places nearby, we have been busy travelling extensively around Asia ever since we arrived in HK, including Tibet, Nepal, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Bali etc. We will be more than happy to share travel tips if any guests are making a trip to other Asian countries too!

In our spare time, we enjoy going on the many fantastic hikes in HK, sipping iced tea and cold beer on the beach, yoga, jazz, good coffee, a good book, and spending time with our furry friends Lola & Rosie. 

You may also meet our lovely helper Jay (she's is from Philippine and enjoys volleyball and table tennis!), who helps us out when we are not around.

When we travel abroad we always use Airbnb. For us, a clean, comfortable and safe place to stay is essential. This is exactly what we offer to any guests staying with us. We hope that our place will be a little home-away-from-home for you during your time in HK.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

I preferred to settle in Hong Kong as the place is as vibrant as the people who play hard, & work hard here. Hong Kong has a 'buzz' you cannot find anywhere else in the world.

I hope to serve you better.  Please do give us private feedback anytime and I valued your feedback and will improve my apartments.

FAQ: When do I pay for my long-term reservation?
www.airbnb.com/help/question/245

Due to the reason that Sep-Apr is peak season, you are advised to make your reservation earlier.   I can only do first book first serve basis, where I won't cancel current booking just because other guests have a longer / bigger booking.  Due to strict cancellation policy, I haven't cancel guest booking so far, except from time to time having guest need to cancel or amend their booking due to different reason and we will considerate case by case (so far only full refund to 1 group of guest as they are able to provide document to proof that their immediate family member need emergency operation). 

Max Capacity is cater to big group consists of family n kids with standard asian size.  If group with members with huge body size or some members prefer to have a bed by their own, not sharing with other, then please split your group into two apartments for more comfortable stay.  I have tried my best to write the apartment description as detail as I could. Please spend time to read through before you book.  I am definitely happy to answer any question that is not in the apartment description.


Contact Number and Email Information will only be released until a booking is made.

Other than work, I'm an aspired yogi, a keen hiker and an avid traveller. I love sun and beach, getting a tan and being in the ocean.

One thing about me is that I was an architecture student and studied conservation. I absolutely LOVE old buildings! I love traveling to different cities and looking at their unique architecture. You see, Hong Kong is pretty much a concrete jungle, but I still managed to find the coolest spot to live. My apartment overlooks into the old colonial prison!! It's a rare hidden gem!

My goal is to have my footprints in all the countries in the world. (How big a goal it is!) I have been to Australia, the UK, Italy, France, Monaco, Holland, Hungary and Korea for travelling, and to the US, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Cambodia mainly for work. I lived in China, Thailand and Mexico for years and now living in my hometown Hong Kong. I enjoy every single moment travelling from one place to another. It's the best time for me to overlook the world and to empty my mind. It is said that the world is becoming smaller and smaller. We are on the southern hemisphere in the morning and appear on the northern in just some hours. The best way for me to feel home anywhere is to meet local people! I listen to their stories and learn their cultures, respect their traditions and share mine with them. This is what travelling means to me.

Thanks to Airbnb, it provides a platform for people to meet friends and look for accommodation at reasonable price. Star-rated hotels are great, but local hosts can give you warm welcome and make you feel home.

I have years of experience hosting foreign guests through couhcsrufnig (CS), but stopped hosting since 2 years ago. After I returned from Mexico to Hong Kong in 2014 to start this hotel business, I found that airbnb is one of the best platforms which combines couhcsrufnig and business into one.

My goal is to have my footprints in all the countries in the world. (How big a goal it is!) I have been to Australia, the UK, Italy, France, Monaco, Holland, Hungary and Korea for travelling, and to the US, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Cambodia mainly for work. I lived in China, Thailand and Mexico for years and now living in my hometown Hong Kong. I enjoy every single moment travelling from one place to another. It's the best time for me to overlook the world and to empty my mind. It is said that the world is becoming smaller and smaller. We are on the southern hemisphere in the morning and appear on the northern in just some hours. The best way for me to feel home anywhere is to meet local people! I listen to their stories and learn their cultures, respect their traditions and share mine with them. This is what travelling means to me.

Thanks to Airbnb, it provides a platform for people to meet friends and look for accommodation at reasonable price. Star-rated hotels are great, but local hosts can give you warm welcome and make you feel home.

I have years of experience hosting foreign guests through couhcsrufnig (CS), but stopped hosting since 2 years ago.

My goal is to have my footprints in all the countries in the world. (How big a goal it is!) I have been to Australia, the UK, Italy, France, Monaco, Holland, Hungary and Korea for travelling, and to the US, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Cambodia mainly for work. I lived in China, Thailand and Mexico for years and now living in my hometown Hong Kong. I enjoy every single moment travelling from one place to another. It's the best time for me to overlook the world and to empty my mind. It is said that the world is becoming smaller and smaller. We are on the southern hemisphere in the morning and appear on the northern in just some hours. The best way for me to feel home anywhere is to meet local people! I listen to their stories and learn their cultures, respect their traditions and share mine with them. This is what travelling means to me.

Thanks to Airbnb, it provides a platform for people to meet friends and look for accommodation at reasonable price. Star-rated hotels are great, but local hosts can give you warm welcome and make you feel home.

My goal is to have my footprints in all the countries in the world. (How big a goal it is!) I have been to Australia, the UK, Italy, France, Monaco, Holland, Hungary and Korea for travelling, and to the US, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Cambodia mainly for work. I lived in China, Thailand and Mexico for years and now living in my hometown Hong Kong. I enjoy every single moment travelling from one place to another. It's the best time for me to overlook the world and to empty my mind. It is said that the world is becoming smaller and smaller. We are on the southern hemisphere in the morning and appear on the northern in just some hours. The best way for me to feel home anywhere is to meet local people! I listen to their stories and learn their cultures, respect their traditions and share mine with them. This is what travelling means to me.

Thanks to Airbnb, it provides a platform for people to meet friends and look for accommodation at reasonable price. Star-rated hotels are great, but local hosts can give you warm welcome and make you feel home.

The Mahjong takes its name from a traditional game that dates back to late Qing dynasty when locals gathered together over a table of 144 game pieces to play and while away the days. Today, the game has evolved into a national pastime and is played everywhere â€“ at home, in the park, even dedicated mahjong parlours around the city. There are various legends on how the game got its name â€“ one being the Mahjong sparrow it was named after, for its petite yet agile body that resembled the game pieces.

The Mahjong takes its name from a traditional game that dates back to late Qing dynasty when locals gathered together over a table of 144 game pieces to play and while away the days. Today, the game has evolved into a national pastime and is played everywhere â€“ at home, in the park, even dedicated mahjong parlours around the city. There are various legends on how the game got its name â€“ one being the Mahjong sparrow it was named after, for its petite yet agile body that resembled the game pieces.

My goal is to have my footprints in all the countries in the world. (How big a goal it is!) I have been to Australia, the UK, Italy, France, Monaco, Holland, Hungary and Korea for travelling, and to the US, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Cambodia mainly for work. I lived in China, Thailand and Mexico for years and now living in my hometown Hong Kong. I enjoy every single moment travelling from one place to another. It's the best time for me to overlook the world and to empty my mind. It is said that the world is becoming smaller and smaller. We are on the southern hemisphere in the morning and appear on the northern in just some hours. The best way for me to feel home anywhere is to meet local people! I listen to their stories and learn their cultures, respect their traditions and share mine with them. This is what travelling means to me.

Thanks to Airbnb, it provides a platform for people to meet friends and look for accommodation at reasonable price. Star-rated hotels are great, but local hosts can give you warm welcome and make you feel home.

I have years of experience hosting foreign guests through couhcsrufnig (CS), but stopped hosting since 2 years ago. After I returned from Mexico to Hong Kong in 2014 to start this hotel business, I found that airbnb is one of the best platforms which combines couhcsrufnig and business into one.

If i am not working , I would be on blasting trails my mountain bike or setting up my rig for some awesome windsurfing down at the beach... yes and surprisingly all is within hand reach in this concrete jungle of Hong Kong and as your friendly host i would love to show you around this beautiful and versatile gem city.

My childhood was spent mainly travelling around with my family of  5 siblings as my father was stationed at several British Army bases around Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong & the UK. Therefore, I enjoy travelling & meeting people of different cultures.

I have travelled to Europe & the States during my student days & most of my family members have now settled in the States & the UK.

I preferred to settle in Hong Kong as the place is as vibrant as the people who play hard, & work hard here. Hong Kong has a 'buzz' you cannot find anywhere else in the world. 

It has been interesting living through the changes from the British colonial days to the handover back to China, & being part of 'history', & revealing of the versatility of the people here to the changing times to not just strive, but thrive in various aspects of their lives & livelihood.

Ryan is from London and Krystal is originally from Hong Kong.

We both run our own businesses and travel regularly for our jobs and for leisure of course! Blessed with the proximity to other fantastic places nearby, we have been busy travelling extensively around Asia ever since we arrived in HK, including Tibet, Nepal, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Bali etc. We will be more than happy to share travel tips if any guests are making a trip to other Asian countries too!

In our spare time, we enjoy going on the many fantastic hikes in HK, sipping iced tea and cold beer on the beach, yoga, jazz, good coffee, a good book, and spending time with our furry friends Lola & Rosie. 

You may also meet our lovely helper Jay (she's is from Philippine and enjoys volleyball and table tennis!), who helps us out when we are not around.

When we travel abroad we always use Airbnb. For us, a clean, comfortable and safe place to stay is essential. This is exactly what we offer to any guests staying with us. We hope that our place will be a little home-away-from-home for you during your time in HK.

It's tucked away in a quiet corner just a strong throw from Central, so that Lan Kwai Fong, and Soho is only a few min walk away. Yet you can still retreat to this lovely home away from the hustle & bustle of the city.<br /><br />Sheung Wan is traditionally a residential neighbourhood famous for its seafood and dried chinese herb trade. Over the past years, the area has slowly gentrified into a wonderful mix of old-meets-new and east-meets-west. You will find award-winning coffee houses right next to rice shops with >50 years history.

Ryan is from London and Krystal is originally from Hong Kong.

We both run our own businesses and travel regularly for our jobs and for leisure of course! Blessed with the proximity to other fantastic places nearby, we have been busy travelling extensively around Asia ever since we arrived in HK, including Tibet, Nepal, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Bali etc. We will be more than happy to share travel tips if any guests are making a trip to other Asian countries too!

In our spare time, we enjoy going on the many fantastic hikes in HK, sipping iced tea and cold beer on the beach, yoga, jazz, good coffee, a good book, and spending time with our furry friends Lola & Rosie. 

You may also meet our lovely helper Jay (she's is from Philippine and enjoys volleyball and table tennis!), who helps us out when we are not around.

When we travel abroad we always use Airbnb. For us, a clean, comfortable and safe place to stay is essential. This is exactly what we offer to any guests staying with us. We hope that our place will be a little home-away-from-home for you during your time in HK.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Blessed with the proximity to other fantastic places nearby, we have been busy travelling extensively around Asia ever since we arrived in HK, including Tibet, Nepal, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Bali etc. We will be more than happy to share travel tips if any guests are making a trip to other Asian countries too!

In our spare time, we enjoy going on the many fantastic hikes in HK, sipping iced tea and cold beer on the beach, yoga, jazz, good coffee, a good book, and spending time with our furry friends Lola & Rosie. 

You may also meet our lovely helper Jay (she's is from Philippine and enjoys volleyball and table tennis!), who helps us out when we are not around.

When we travel abroad we always use Airbnb. For us, a clean, comfortable and safe place to stay is essential. This is exactly what we offer to any guests staying with us. We hope that our place will be a little home-away-from-home for you during your time in HK.

I love Tokyo and seeing the amazing sights and people.  It is a great place to explore and every day can be different.  This is an awesome destination for walkers and wanders filled with friendly people, tasty restaurants, and plenty of lights.   My tip is to make the initial contact with Japanese people because they are typically shy at first.   They will be happy to try to practice their English with you.
